-Run the program
-Click the "new" icon
-Choose one of the brep files.  (I have not found a step file that it likes.)
-On the purple toolbar, click the icon that shows one face selected.  Click on a face on the object.
-On the gray toolbar, click on the icon with the black, red, and blue lines. Give it a minute.
-Click the code icon next to it, type in a file name.
-That's it!


Nonfunctional buttons on toolbars:
-green and yellow bar each have 2 buttons which do nothing right now.
-button on orange bar does nothing.
-middle buttons on purple bar are not useful.
-open, save, undo, redo do nothing.

I tried to contact him, no luck... he seems to have dissapeared.  There are no web pages mentioning his name.
