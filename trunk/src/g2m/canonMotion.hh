\class canonMotion
\brief This class is for the canonical commands STRAIGHT_TRAVERSE, STRAIGHT_FEED, and ARC_FEED.
canonMotion is an ABC. Its children should only be instantiated via canonLine::canonLineFactory(), which creates linearMotion objects for STRAIGHT_TRAVERSE and STRAIGHT_FEED commands, and helicalMotion objects for ARC_FEED commands.

Note, you may find variations in the terminology I use - I misremembered some of the canonical commands issued by the interpreter. For example, I thought it issued LINEAR_FEED but it's actually STRAIGHT_FEED. So the class linearMotion could have been named straightMotion.

Also, rapid and traverse are used interchangeably, at least in my comments...
