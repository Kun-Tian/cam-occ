\section    cam CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing)

            While I originally intended to write a CAM program, I haven't proceded very far in that direction. Currently there is no way to generate g-code from this program. If you are looking for useable open-source CAM, try HeeksCNC.

\section    g2m Gcode-to-model

            Using EMC2's stand-alone interpreter, gcode is converted into a series of simple canonical commands which are then processed to create a 3d model of the material to be removed. See classes g2m and canonLine, and the classes that inherit from the latter.

\section	install Installation

			To install and compile the library, unzip the source file into a folder
			of your choice and open a command prompt there.
			<pre>
				qmake
				make
			</pre>
			to build the package.

\section    run Running the program

            Because cam-occ uses libraries, you will need to add bin/ to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Alternately, edit the file camocc.sh to suit.

            Command line: Currently, cam-occ recognizes the argument 'g2m', followed by an optional file name. This will load a .ngc or .canon file and build a model from it.

            For debugging, there is debug.sh which sets environment variables and then runs gdb.
